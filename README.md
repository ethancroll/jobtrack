Hello all!
Jobtrac is a simple command line income tracker for jobs. The results are saved to a txt file. To change the earning rate, change the time.Sleep in the addcash() function. If ou have any problems, or suggestions, please post them on the issues tab, and I will attend to them as soon as I can. 
Have a great one!
